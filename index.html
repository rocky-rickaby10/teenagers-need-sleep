    <h1>Teenagers Need More Sleep!</h1>

      It has long been pointed out that teenagers perform the worst at 
      school but one thing nobody ever ask is, <i><strong>why?</i></strong>
      Well I have the answer and it is because of the lack of sleep!
      They actually tested this and the results were quite obvious:
    </pre>
    <div class="container">
      <ul class="mylist">
        <li>Increased attendance rates</li>
        <li>Decrease in disciplinary action</li>
        <li>Increase in state assessment scores</li>
        <li>Increase in student's attention</li>
        <li>Decrease in students sleeping during instruction</li>
      </ul>
    </div><br>
    <pre>
      Why aren't they doing this then? Well, it makes things harder for the
      schools, and schools don't care enough to actually try to make things
      better for their students. As stated by <a href="https://www.apa.org/topics/children/school-start-times" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">apa.org</a>, one of the websites
      to share the results on why:
    </pre>
    <div class="container">
      <ul class="mylist">
        <li>Increased cost, congestion, & delays associated with having busses on the road later in the morning. </li>
        <li>Inability of parents to rely on older children for afternoon childcare, as the lower schools would have effectively switched schedules with the upper schools.</li>
        <li>Scheduling conflicts for intervarsity/interscholastic events with neighboring jurisdictions that have earlier dismissal.</li>
      </ul>
    </div><br>
    <pre>
      Now these issues could be worked around if they were willing 
      to make the effort, and they aren't. It's not even just one website,
      even the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/sleep/features/schools-start-too-early.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CDC</a> <i>(Centers for Disease Control)</i> has pointed this out, 
      and pointed out the same, plus even <i>more</i> possible side effects of not 
      getting enough sleep, including:
    </pre>
    <div class="container">
      <ul class="mylist">
        <li>Being overweight.</li>
        <li>Not engaging in daily physical activity.</li>
        <li>Suffering from symptoms of depression.</li>
        <li>Engaging in unhealthy risk behaviors such as drinking, smoking tobacco, and using illicit drugs.</li>
      </ul>
    </div><br>
    <pre>
      So it definitely <i>isn't</i> a new idea, and there are <i>more</i> than enough reasons
      to do it. There <i>are</i> some good reasons for not doing it too, but the proven
      benefits far outweigh the costs, and would be worth it, for the teachers,
      because they wouldn't have to constantly get student's attention, the parents
      because they don't have to stress over their kids not getting stuff done, 
      and more importantly, the students, because they get enough sleep, and get
      work done! So in the end, it is definitely a good idea, and it would be worth
      it to implement.
